# MHHS-Dataset

When photovoltaic modules are in operation, if a single cell within the module experiences reduced current due to shading or inherent issues, and the working current exceeds that of the individual cell, then that cell will be in a reverse bias state. In the circuit, its function shifts from being a power source to a load, consuming energy. This results in localized overheating within the module, leading to hotspots. Therefore, hotspot defect is a crucial defect that seriously affects the normal operation of photovoltaic farms. Hotspot defects can be attributed to the following reasons: 1) Shadows from leaves and dust; 2) Damaged surface tempered glass; 3) Diode failure or poor soldering of the junction box; 4) Internal battery pack failure; 5) Blown or open fuse. The generation of hotspot defects can reduce the efficiency of PV systems, shorten the life of PV modules, and even cause fires. Therefore, it is crucial to identify hotspot defects promptly and accurately, improve the operational safety of PV farms, and reduce downtime.


## 2023 Dataset Access Instructions:

We have constructed the Multi-altitude Hotspot Defect Dataset (MMHS), which contains 9,148 infrared images from photovoltaic power stations across four altitudes. Specifically, there are 1,738 images from 28m, 2,323 images from 35m, 1,820 images from 47m, and 3,222 images from 60m. These images have a resolution of 640Ã—512, and the ground truth hotspots were annotated using the LabelImg tool. Detailed information is provided in the table below:


| MHHS | defective images | defect-free images | Total |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| HIR-28m | 783 | 1045 | 1783 |
| HIR-35m | 1334 | 989 | 2323 |
| HIR-47m | 1078 | 742 | 1820 |
| HIR-60m | 2446 | 776 | 3222 |
